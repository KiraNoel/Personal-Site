        This is a personality quiz I made which prompts the user to make a milkshake to find out if they're an introvert, ambivert, omnivert, or an extrovert.

        In the early months of 2020 my humanities class spent time to discuss the Black Lives Matter movement and how we could have a discussion about
        it in our school. A few friends and I came up with the idea of making a fist out of origami roses. The roses represent the many lives lost to police
        brutality. We also hosted discussions in our school to foster connection between students of color and teachers and administrators.

        In 2019, my club soccer team and I traveled to North Carolina to participate in the National League showcase. This is a showcase where many 
        college coaches come to watch and recruite players for their college. It was also my first time traveling to North Carolina.

      I got the oppurtunity to travel with the Girls Ellington Project to Reno, Nevada to play at a Jazz Education Conference in 2019. While we were there
      we met iconic players in the jazz community and we got to try out different instruments they had for display.

        This is a highlight video made up of clips from my soccer career. I use this video 
        in emails to college coaches to get recruited for college.
