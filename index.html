      Hi! Thank you for visiting my site. My name is Kira Apodaca. I am a rising junior at Nathan Hale High School in Seattle, Washington. 
      I love to listen to music, play soccer, and play piano. 
      At school I am involved in the club CAPS, Coalition for Asian and Pcific Islander Students. 
      I am also part of RoboRaiders, the robotics team at Nathan Hale. Along, with being part of these clubs I am also in the jazz band,
      which is held as a zero period class, and I am one of the captains for the Nathan Hale Girls Varsity Soccer Team. I am devoted to 
      enriching the environment at my school through extracurriculars. 
    </p>

    <p class= "aboutMe">
      Outside of school I play soccer at Eastside FC and I am part of the Girls Ellington Project at JazzEd, a non-profit music program. The Girls Ellinton Project gives a 
      place to girls where they can play music with other girls. Many school jazz bands including mine have very few girls, so this gives us an oppurtunity
      to meet other girls who have similar experiences in the jazz world.
