      Marie Kondo
      </h4>
      
      <p>
        I recently read two of Marie Kondo's books "The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up" and "Spark Joy". After reading these books I was able
        to declutter my room even more and got rid of many of my clothes. This has not only brought joy to my own life bute has given intention in 
        how I put clothes away. Rather than stuffing my clothes into a drawer, I take time to fold them so they are able to stand up on their own and 
        place them in my drawer. I think this helps me feel more put together and gives me a more positive mindset.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After I finished decluttering my room I haven't encountered a pileup of clothes in my hamper or stuffed animals out of their spot. I have also 
        felt neater in general, leading to a small bit of pride behind my folded clothes and my organized drawers. Everytime I look around my room I feel
        like I have accomplished something that took a lot of time and effort and that sparks joy in me.
      </p>

      My Bullet Journal
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      I use my bullet journal in the place of a planner. I write down my to-do lists and events I am attending in my
      bullet journal. Having a bullet journal structure allows me to configure my a planne system to suit me. For example, I love to collect data,
      so I keep habit trackers in my bullet journal so I can look at how often I'm getting 8+ hours asleep or how often I am reading. Logging 
      this data into my bullet journal is yet another incentive to do those habits. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bullet journalling is effective for me because it lets me be creative in making weekly and monthly spreads. It also gives me a place to practice
      handlettering and use my stationary collection. Overall, a bullet journal is a wonderful tool to keep my mind organized.
    </p>
